        <li><strong>Common Name:</strong> Eastern Wolf</li>

    <h2>General Appearance</h2>
    
    <p>The Eastern Wolf is conspecific (belonging to the same species) with the Red Wolf (presently recognized as Canis rufus), a species that was extirpated from the wild in the southeastern United States.  Eastern Wolves (and therefore Red Wolves) are very small in size compared to the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) living in the boreal forest north of Lake Superior in Ontario. Unlike the Gray Wolf, the Eastern Wolf in Algonquin Park has never been recorded with an all-black or all-white coat. Most people lucky enough to catch a quick glimpse of an Eastern Wolf in the wild for the first time are surprised by the animal's small size (only about 60 to 68 centimetres at the shoulder). People from more southern areas dominated by agriculture often believe that they have seen a Coyote (Canis latrans) in Algonquin Park. Coyotes are generally absent from Algonquin Park, since wolves will regularly kill any trespasser into their territory and Coyotes have a difficult time finding food in completely forested environments.</p>
    
    <h2>Food Source</h2>

    <p>Wolves in Algonquin Park eat three primary prey species which include White-tailed Deer, Moose, and Beaver. Wolves prey primarily on White-tailed Deer, but both Moose and Beaver are very important secondary food sources, and may be the primary food sources at certain times of the year.</p>
    
    <h2>Sounds</h2>
    
    <p>When people think of wolf sound, most people think of wolf howling. Biologists believe that wolves use howling for a variety of functions. The single howl, or only one wolf howling, may be used to keep in contact with other members of the pack while the pack is spread out and not in visual contact. In this situation, in human terms, one wolf may be saying to the other "I'm over here. Where are you?" A pack howl containing more than one wolf is suspected to be used to defend a pack's territory from other possible intruders. In this situation, the pack is saying "This is our territory, keep out!". The final reason some biologist believe wolves may howl is for social cohesion, much like a family of humans all singing around the holiday season. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in-RNuQMy6Y">Wolf Howling: Tourists flock to Algonquin Park</a></p>
    
    <h2>Breeding</h2>
    
    <img src="images/wolf_pups.jpg" alt="wolf pups">
    
    <p>Mating takes place in February between the two leaders of the pack (the alpha male and alpha female). Wolf pups are born approximately 63 days later in a den which has been excavated in the ground. Generally from 4-7 pups are born per pack. The pups are nursed by the mother for the first six to eight weeks. Once weaned, they rely on other members of the pack to feed them. Initially, the adults carry food in their stomachs to the pups. The pups pull on the corners of an adult's mouth until the partially digested food is regurgitated. As the pups mature throughout the summer and early fall, they are able to eat solid food brought back by the adults. During late July or August, when the pups have become too big for the den site, they are moved to large open areas such as a bog or Beaver meadow where the pups are left while the adult members of the pack head off hunting. During this time the pups are not yet big or strong enough to hunt with the rest of the pack. These rendezvous sites as they are known act as a playpen for the pups while the adults are away. The sites provide protection for pups, a source of water, shelter, and numerous small animals and insects hidden in the grasses that the pups pursue in efforts to hone their hunting skills.</p>
